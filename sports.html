          In a surprising move, star football player Derek "The Beast" Johnson
          has decided to play his entire season in Virtual Reality (VR) instead
          of on the field. Johnson, known for his brutal hits and
          record-breaking touchdowns, is now wearing a custom VR headset during
          practices and games.

          In an astonishing display of athleticism, Olympic swimmer Michael
          Phelps has set a new world record for the fastest swim — in zero
          gravity. Using a specially designed swimming pool aboard the
          International Space Station (ISS), Phelps managed to complete a
          100-meter freestyle in just 36.5 seconds, breaking his own Earth-bound
          record.
